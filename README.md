## 📈 What You Can Track with MLflow
### 🔹 **Metrics**
Track various evaluation metrics to assess model performance:
- **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score**
- **Loss (Training & Validation)**
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**
- **Custom metrics** (e.g., RMSE, MAE)

### 🔹 **Parameters**
Log hyperparameters and configurations for reproducibility:
- **Model Hyperparameters**: Learning rate, max depth, number of trees, etc.
- **Data Processing Parameters**: Train-test split ratio, feature selection criteria.
- **Feature Engineering Parameters**: Encoding techniques, scaling methods.

### 🔹 **Artifacts**
Save and retrieve essential artifacts for future reference:
- **Trained Models & Checkpoints**
- **Model Summaries & Architectures**
- **Plots (ROC Curves, Feature Importances, Loss Curves, etc.)**
- **Confusion Matrices & Evaluation Reports**
- **Scripts, Jupyter Notebooks, Input Data Files**
- **Environment Files (requirements.txt, conda.yaml)**

### 🔹 **Model Registry & Deployment**
- **Model Versioning**: Assign unique versions to each model.
- **Lifecycle Stages**: Manage `Staging`, `Production`, and `Archived` models.
- **ONNX & Pickled Models**: Save models in multiple formats.
- **Deployment Tracking**: Log model deployment details.

### 🔹 **Source Code & Reproducibility**
- **Git Integration**: Track experiment-specific Git commit hashes.
- **Dependency Logging**: Ensure consistency across different environments.

### 🔹 **Run & Experiment Details**
- **Unique Run ID** for every experiment.
- **Experiment Grouping** for better organization.
- **Timestamps** to log start and end times.
- **Custom Tags** for metadata tracking (e.g., author, project phase, cloud provider).
